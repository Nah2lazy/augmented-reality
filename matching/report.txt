When matching objects that have defining features the less errors occur, but matching images with repitition more errors occur.
Changing the angle the object is viewed upon creates more errors.
When matching objects with the same angle there may still be errors due to the repition of the image, this occurs with plants.
Reducing the image resolution eliminates errors but also creates new ones as a result.
